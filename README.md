This is Alessio Ricci's and Emanuel Diktonius' original work for the mini project in the course IS1200.

The project was done using Windows' WSL2 to access Linux and therefore uses the Linux based toolchain for the DE10-Lite dtekv board.
How to compile and run the program will be explained in further detail inside the dedicated folders, as well as how to actually "play" or run the program for yourself.
See the files labeled with workflow for this information.
