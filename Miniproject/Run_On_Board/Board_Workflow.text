There is not much to tell for this part of the project as we quickly realized going further with using the board 
would require extra hardware that we did not feel we had the time for. The idea is simple however. Using usbipd 
we can connect a USB mouse to WSL2 and access it's position via "/dev/input/mice". The rest would be very 
similar as to how the program is executed in the Emulator. Below you will see the start of using the mouse as an
I/O device in WSL2.
